# datasette-quickchart
Datasette plugin for making quick charts from tables and SQL queries using Apex Charts. It only takes 2 clicks to make a first chart.

## Installation

The plugin is single-file and 100% JS, so no installation via PyPI packages is required. Just add a link to your Datasette configuration:

- if you use YAML format:
```yaml
extra_js_urls:
- https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/commongeek/datasette-quickchart@latest/quickchart.js
```

- if you use JSON format:
```json
  "extra_js_urls": [
    "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/commongeek/datasette-quickchart@latest/quickchart.js"
  ]
```
The plugin will then add itself to every Datasette table and query view.
If you want to host locally you need to copy the quickchart.js file to your static directory and modify the URL accordingly.

## Configuration

Currently, the only configurable option is to choose the color palette used by the charts (compatible with https://apexcharts.com/docs/options/theme/). The default is palette7 because it seems to me to be the most consistent with the Datasette color scheme.

You can set the palette number by adding an argument to the script URL, e.g.
```bash
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/commongeek/datasette-quickchart@latest/quickchart.js?palette=1
```

| Recognition of data types | + | The plugin analyzes all data in each column and assigns it one of the following types: numeric, categorical, date/time or null (if all values in the column are null). Timestamps are interpreted as numbers. I donâ€™t know how to change that yet. |
